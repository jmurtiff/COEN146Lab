Step 2: 
	a. nestat: Displays active TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, 
	IPv4 statistics, and IPv6 statistics. Basically displays all different network interfaces and all active sockets.

	b. ifconfig: Displays the configuration of all active network interfaces. From this you could enable and disable an 
	interface and easily troubleshoot your configurations. 

	c. hostname: Returns "linux11116" which is the hostname of the system. From this command we can also set the hostname 
	to whatever we would like.

	d. ping: on its own the "ping" command doesn't really do anything. However, you can use ping in combination with a destination 
	to send an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST and get an ECHO_RESPONSE from the host of gateway. Essentially a call and response to test time elapsed. 
	This is great for getting an understanding of the response time between servers and computers and how distance and server 
	location impacts this response time.

	e. traceroute: When I type "traceroute google.com" it shows me the path a packet took from my given computer to the destination. 
	Furthermore it tells you how much time has elapsed. Its a great way to get an understanding of the where the packet is and how
	long it takes for it to move through the different routers and network switches.

	f.  telnet: Interacting with remote computers. Allows you to give a specific ip and port to test whether it is open or 
	not. It allows you to test the connectivity to remote machines and issue commands or get information from remote computers/servers.

	g: host/dig: Used for verifying and troubleshooting DNS problems as well as displaying answers (system name) from 
	requested server. Essentially performs DNS lookups

	h: route: Shows/manipulate the IP routing table, which can be used for setting up static routes to specific host or networks via 
	a given interface.

	i: arp: Manipulates or displays the kernel's ARP cache. Can add,delete, or display the current content of the cache. The primary options of this command are 
	clearing an address mapping entry and manually setting up one.

Step 3: 
	Using:
	US: www.google.com (216.58.195.68)
	Europe: www.tourismthailand.org (13.250.185.69)
	Asia: baidu.com (220.181.38.148)

	Part a. 
	US: 
		1. With packets of size 32 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		2. With packets of size 64 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		3. With packets of size 76 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		76 bytes is the largest packet size we can use to ping www.google.com
	Europe:
		1. With packets of size 32 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		2. With packets of size 64 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		3. With packets of size 128 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		4. With packets of size 256 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		5. With packets of size 512 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		6. With packets of size 1048 bytes, 0% packet loss.
	Asia:
		1. With packets of size 32 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		2. With packets of size 64 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		3. With packets of size 128 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		4. With packets of size 256 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		5. With packets of size 512 bytes, 0% packet loss.
		6. With packets of size 1048 bytes, 0% packet loss.

	Part b.
	US:
		1. With packets of size 32 bytes, RTT is 2.429 ms.
		2. With packets of size 64 bytes, RTT is 2.512 ms.
		3. With packets of size 76 bytes, RTT is 2.401 ms.
	Europe: 
		1. With packets of size 32 bytes, RTT is 186.343 ms.
		2. With packets of size 64 bytes, RTT is 191.699 ms.
		3. With packets of size 128 bytes, RTT is 188.416 ms.
		4. With packets of size 256 bytes, RTT is 187.758 ms.
		5. With packets of size 512 bytes, RTT is 188.296 ms.
		6. With packets of size 1048 bytes, RTT is 188.594 ms.
	Asia:
		1. With packets of size 32 bytes, RTT is 141.485 ms.
		2. With packets of size 64 bytes, RTT is 143.340 ms.
		3. With packets of size 128 bytes, RTT is 141.678 ms.
		4. With packets of size 256 bytes, RTT is 141.780 ms.
		5. With packets of size 512 bytes, RTT is 142.269 ms.
		6. With packets of size 1048 bytes, RTT is 141.467 ms.

	Part c. 
	These results make sense when you think about the location of the servers in relation to my computer. 
	US is the shortest time since the server is in the same continent. Next down the list is Asia, since it has 
	to go all the way through the US to the east coast, then through Europe and finally over to Asia. And lastly Europe, 
	because it is the first country after the Atlantic undersea cable. The times may not make 100% sense, but you also have
	to remember that baidu.com had multiple different ip addresses, so I may have pinged a closer server than intended (and that
	is why the time is shorter for that Asia then for Europe).

Step 5: 
	Part a. 
	I get the response of:
	Trying 128.119.245.12...
	Connected to gaia.cs.umass.edu.
	Escape character is '^]'.

	Part b. 
	Returned is an HTML page detailing the webpage that contains the interactive end-of-chapter 
	exercises for our Computer Networking textbook. In essence, it is the same as if we 
	went to the specific webpage and viewed the "page source".

	Part c.
	What is the name of the file that is being retrieved in this GET message? 
	   -The name of the file is index.php.
	
	What version of HTTP is the client running?
	   -The verion of HTTP that the client is running is version 1.1.

	What formats of text and images, if any?
	   -The formats of the webpage include tables, <p>, lists, links, and images (specifically.jpg).

Step 6:
	US: When I do the command:
			telnet www.google.com 80
			
		I get the response of:
			Trying 216.58.195.68...
			Connected to www.google.com.
			Escape character is '^]'.

		But when I instead do:
			telnet www.google.com 3389

		I get the response of:
			Trying 216.28.195.68...
			and it never stops until I stop the process
	
	Europe: When I do the command:
			telnet www.tourismthailand.org 80
		
		I get the response of:
			Trying 13.250.185.69...
			Connected to www.tourismthailand.org
			Escape character is '^]'.
		
		But when I instead do:
			telnet www.tourismthailand.org 3389

		I get the response of:
			Trying 13.250.185.69...
			and it never stops until I stop the process

	Asia: When I do the command:
			telnet baidu.com 80

		I get the response of:
			Trying 220.181.38.148...
			Connected to www.baidu.com
			Escape character is '^]'.

		But when I instead do:
			telnet www.baidu.org 3389

		I get the response of:
			Trying 220.181.38.148...
			and it never stops until I stop the process
		
		So at the end of the day trying to connect using port 3389 does not seem to work
		for all three of the possible hosts, but public port 80 does seem to work for all
		three of the possible hosts.
