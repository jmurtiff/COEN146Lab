# Title: Lab 1 - Questions, Observations, and Notes

1. Run the program by typing ./ExecutableName and take a note of your observation.
    Observation: When I run the program by typing ./Part1 I get a return of "segmentation fault (core dumped) since we did not 
    enter a command line parameter for the number of microseconds that the parent and child process must sleep before moving 
    to the next iteration of the for loops.

2. Re-run the program by typing ./ExecutableName  3000. Note that the delay in the loop depends on the 
command line argument you give, here the delay is 3000 microseconds. 

Question: Enter delays of 500 and 5000, what happens?
    Answer: Entering a Delay of 500 makes the program complete much faster than a delay of 5000.
    The higher the number the longer the delay in between the iterations of the for loop for both processes and the longer the 
    program takes to run. Even though both programs complete successfully no matter the number of microseconds the user inputs, the
    higher the parameter of microseconds, the longer the program takes to finish.
